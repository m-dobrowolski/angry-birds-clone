# Simple Angry Birds clone

A minimal physics-based Angry Birdsâ€“style clone built with Pygame (for rendering) and Pymunk (for 2D physics).  

This project was developed in my first semester of studies, for the course *Podstawy Informatyki i Programowania* (Introduction to Computer Science and Programming). The goal was to practice basic programming, physics simulations, and simple game development.

## Requirements
- Python(3.11+ recommended)
- Pygame
- Pymunk

## Instruction
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/m-dobrowolski/angry-birds-clone.git
